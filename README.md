# verb-toys
Verb-Toys assignment

Assignment was to create 'toys' that center on a specific verb. For me, Survive and Avoid, along with a few others

Playable at https://dcrep.github.io/verb-toys/

's' key switches between toys (2 currently)

Left-click on either the grapple point or a balloon and Drag over to the 'runners' to help avoid the gap

Objects created using Unity primitives
